# Simulation-of-Electrical-Systems-by-Quadripoles

Repository dedicated to the development of the modeling and simulation project of an **Electric Power System**, from the Electrical Circuits II subject of the Electrical Engineering course at UFCG.

The resolution will consist of a *Jupyter Notebook* to model and simulate the system components, using the *NumPy* library.

The members of this group are:

- Breno Henrique Martins Silva ([@brenohmartins](https://github.com/brenohmartins))
